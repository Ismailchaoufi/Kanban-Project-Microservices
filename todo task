1.catch the error and display it in front end as a popup instide of console
2.solve the accept invitations in email, impliment the fonctionality in front end when click in accept invitation in email side (frontend)

i wanna stop, and watch a formation course tutorial videos
i wanna apply for jobs and watch videos about freelance


new plan :
i did the invitation members by email
now when i click in the invitation link in email it took me to login i didn't see the component accept invitation
when i drag and drop the status of the task should change dynamically without refreshing the page




still have a problem:
the problem that when i click the invitation link it took directly in login and when i create an account becaude
i dont have account and thien when connect and when go in emails to click again then show the invitation component and
go to projects but i wanna in the first when i click the link for first time it should take me to invitation compoennt and
verify if i had account or not then apply invitation componnet logic that s what i want i think the problem in front end not backend
(done)


problem :
the status of task doesn't change in real time
the changes should change in real time
in dashboard the tasks assigned doesn't display
fix dashboard
